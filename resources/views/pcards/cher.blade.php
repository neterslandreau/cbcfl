            Cher Rosselot practically grew up at the Academy at Griffin Harbor.
            Ms.Cher has been a member of the staff since 1999.
            She began her career with the Academy working in our infant room.
            Since that time she has worked in virtually every capacity at the center.
            Both of her children also attended the preschool.
            Cher has a keen understanding of both the mission and values of Community Bible Church and the Academy.
            In her spare time she enjoys spending time with her children and two grandchildren.
